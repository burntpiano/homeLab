- How downstream data is transferred from ISPs to your modem via coaxial cable
  - Spoilers: It's awful and overly complicated
  - Most infrastructure is horribly slipshod due to property management/HOAs
- Terminating your own patch cables is significantly cheaper* than buying them
  new
  - It's also a lot easier than what people will lead you to believe
    - No seriously
- KVMs are necessary
- Segmentation keeps you safe while you play around with networking
  - With a family, the data **must** flow
  - Obviously also applies to untrustworthy devices
    - Looking at you IoT
- Firewalls are great
- Watch your `rm /mnt/dir/*` commands carefully
  - No, but really
