## Home Lab!

If you're here, you're looking at my _very casual_ homelab write up. The
intention isn't to show you a step by step guide on how to implement your own,
as there's a myriad of other sources that will your preferred level of verbosity
and skill level.

This more or less exists to showcase my \[current\] iteration of my homelab.
Obviously, things ebb and flow with current needs, hardware availability, and
time allotted for tinkering.
