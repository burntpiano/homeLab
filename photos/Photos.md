  <p align="center">No images of the actual PC build were taken during the process, however, you can see the PC in the lower right hand corner.</p>
  <p align="center">It was at this point that I came to the realization that I needed a true home for all of this as it's scope began to grow.</p>

  <p align="center">Due to space constraints, the SATA cables were pressed up against the GPU fan and the motor failed. Fortunately I had a dead card that I was able to salvage. Note the Zotac branding in contrast to the Gigabye fans.</p>

  <p align="center">I was able to transfer the node into an affordable server chassis. From my estimates, this has improved the legitamcy of the server by 30%.</p>
